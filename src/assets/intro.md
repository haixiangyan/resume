## First view
My name is Haixiang, a talented student in UCI. I have a great passion in Frontend Development and have already worked on so many personal projects with popular web frameworks, like Overwatch UI (NPM downloads: 11K+), Code Block Beautifier (Users: 500+) and an online guitar editor. From 06/2019 to 09/2019, I worked on the LAANC project by using Vue.js and Mapbox as a frontend intern in DJI. I collaborated on a technical timeline for the project, detailing tasks to front-end engineers in both Palo Alto and Shenzhen and helped to migrate the project to a new UI design.

## Third view
Haixiang is a master student at UC Irvine majoring in networked system.  He owns such a great passion for Frontend Development that he has already developed bunches of personal projects like Overwatch UI (NPM downloads: 11K+), Code Block Beautifier (Users: 500+) and an online guitar sheet music editor with popular web frameworks.   

From 06/2019 to 09/2019, he had his internship at DJI, where he worked on the LAANC project by using Vue.js and Mapbox as a frontend inter.  He also collaborated on a technical timeline for the project, detailing tasks to front-end engineers in both Palo Alto and Shenzhen and helped to migrate the project to a new UI design.  

Besides, he has good communication skills.  I once collaborated with him in which we had to discuss our designs and debug together.  The whole process was comfortable and smooth because of his respectful and open attitude.  He explained ideas and concepts proactively with team members and open to take advice from others. That made me regard him as a really good team player.

Due to his rich experience, great passion and professional skills,  I think he will be a competent candidate for our company. Therefore, I’d like to refer him to these positions.
